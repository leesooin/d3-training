# Assignment 3 (Part 4)

### Viz Critique
* Bad
    * the line graph covers the number of orders (rescale one or both of the y-axes to make sure no numbers are covered)
    * could have changed "last year" in the title to "2014" and taken out the year on the x-axis
    * could include more context in the title (e.g., product type, store)
    * the labels in the legend can be improved (e.g., "orderID" = "Total Count of Orders")
    * could label the x-axis and use numbers to indicate different months rather than spelling each of them out
    * the fact that the sales y-axis starts from 100K may be misleading
    * make the two colors shades more distinguisable 

* Good
    * not overwhelming although it is a dual axis chart (simplicity and high data-ink ratio)
    * Units for sales
    
* My visualization description
    * I think this visualization is okay considering that the trends are similar. I would simply take the above 7 points from the "Bad" section into consideration.
