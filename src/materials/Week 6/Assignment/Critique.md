* Good
    * It is nice that selecting particular countries doesn't make the unselected ones disappear but simply makes them slightly blurred. I think this feature allows users to see the chosen countries’ characteristics with respect to the overall trends.
    * It is easy to see the change in characteristics over time. The lines that connect the bubbles (trails) are helpful in understanding the visualization especially when things changed drastically without clear patterns.
    * It tells you where a country is in the visualization very explicitly (what its life expectancy, income are) when you hover over it.
* Bad
    * The color and size dropdown menus have lots and lots of options.
	    * This allows users to complicate things very quickly, making the visualization less meaningful.
	    * It would be nice if these dropdown menus were more user-friendly.
* Good and Bad
    * There are lots of options. 
    	* e.g., “options” at the bottom; the color and size dropdown menus
    * It does not seem necessary to have the “deselect” option and the “lock” option although they are 'cool' features. 
* My visualization description
    * I would simplify it a little bit by reducing the number of options provided to users.
