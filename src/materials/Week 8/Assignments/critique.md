# Assignment 8 (Part 3)

### Viz Critique
* Context - The visualization provides users with context in the intro, which is helpful. Since the intro felt a little too long and boring for me, having the option to skip it was nice.
* Context - How it provides more detailed information when you hover over a country helps to understand the visualization. Though it would be nice for the numbers that pop up to be more clearly incorporated into the visualization.
* Color - Some features of the visualization are hard to read because of they are too dark (e.g., some of the texts in the background, lines that connect different countries)
* Complexity - I am not sure if users will be able to understand this visualization without going through the intro; how data are represented in circles and how there are lines connecting different countries within the circles seem to immediately give users the impression that there is just "too much going on" in the visualization. It also doesn't help that the some of the lines are very difficult to see.
* Purpose - is swapping "source country" and "target country" really necessary? Reason for the set number of countries you can eliminate from the circles?
