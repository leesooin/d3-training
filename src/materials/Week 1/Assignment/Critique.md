# Assignment 1

### Viz 1
* Good
    * easy to compare products within strategy (simplicity)
    * labels: title and axes (completeness)
    * the order in which products are shown in the legend matches the order they are displayed in the plot area (objectivity)

* Bad
    * the total makes it look like there is a trend across strategies (focus)
    * two y-axes that are on different scales (simplicity)
    * the title makes it look like the purpose of this visualization is comparing sales strategy (intentionality)
    * the colors may not be easily distinguishable (accessibility)
    * no units in y-axes (completeness)

* My visualization description
    * leave the title as is, get rid of different products, and only show totals in a bar graph with units

### Viz 2
* Good
    * the raw count in each box is helpful in reading this plot (completeness)
* Bad
    * no title (completeness)
    * unclear what the axes represent (completeness)
    * no units in y-axis (completeness)
    * very difficult to read the texts in the legend, and there seem to be too many categories (simplicity, accessibility, data-ink ratio)
    * not clear what the percentages represent and how they are calculated (intentionality, objectivity)
    * unclear purpose (focus, objectivity, intentionality)
* My visualization description
    * label axes
    * include title
    * remove the percentages and numbers in the plot area
    * highlight a single category, URGO
    * rather than arbitrarily putting the percentages, show the reference raw counts

### Viz 3
* Good
    * a plot with title per purpose rather than putting all the information in a single plot (intentionality)
* Bad
    * the pumpkins and circles are not necessarily proportional to the numbers shown (objectivity)
    * give more context: is the sample composed of adults only? what is the total sample size used? (objectivity, completeness)
    * difficult to read the texts and numbers (completeness)
    * unnecessarily decorative (data-ink ratio)
* My visualization description
    * include more context: include the total sample size and sampling unit 
    * change the Annual Spending on Halloween plot to be a line graph to represent trend over time
    * change the Average Spending per Person by Item plot to be a bar graph
    * remove the picture on the far right
