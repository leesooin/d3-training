# Assignment 2

### Viz 1
* Good
    * seems easy to navigate (change metrics, etc.)
* Bad
    * not as easy to immediately gather information from the Sales Pipeline Information table, compared to from other graphs
    * not clear what green/yellow/red represent in the Quarterly Performance to Goal graphs
    * difficult to get precise information from the pie charts
    	* e.g., difficult to compare the percentages of the red and blue categories in the Product Revenue Distribution chart
    * might have seemed more consistent if the Monthly Performance graphs and Quarterly Performance graphs were presented in the same format
    	* e.g., show the quarterly performance in a line graph
* My visualization description
    * put together the monthly and quarterly performance graphs and highlight necessary components
    * though it is difficult to read the table, it seems reasonable to extract only a few important things from it
    * use bar graphs rather than pie charts

### Viz 2
* Good
    * clear titles
* Bad
    * making the pie charts 3D seems unnecessary
    * graphs, except the pie charts, are too small
    * not clear what the categories are (columns, rows)
    	* unless columns are associated with time, presenting them in a line graph is not helpful
    * too much going on in the Sales vs. Cost of Sales graph (in particular)
* My visualization description
    * simplify the sales vs. cost of sales graph
    * give option of viewing sales vs. cost or sales vs. margin (one at a time)
    * depending on one chooses to view sales vs. cost or sales vs. margin, highlight things in a simple table showing % difference (rather than in a line graph)
    * use bar graphs rather than pie charts
    * give option to select categories for the averages for sales graph (to avoid crowding the graph)

### Viz 3
* Good
    * easy to compare the percentages of two different periods of time
    * easy to compare the percentages of New Orleans Saints and platform average
    * simple yet there is a theme that is consistent with the data
    * given the data are broken down, the stacked bars are easy to compare
* Bad
    * if colorblind, may be difficult to compare New Orleans Saints and platform average
    	* y axis may be labeled to account for this
    * potential redundancy 
    	* values for different colors (24 hrs - no return) are labeled on top of the chart for two different visitors
* My visualization description
    * use a single color rather than two (blue and black) and label different visitors (Saints/platform average)
    * put the question (how frequently...?) with the legend
    * "most frequent" and "no return" on the sides are now with the legend
    * (perhaps) clearer title
